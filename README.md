# Ingot project
Ingot is an infinite playspace for information.

Information is built from squares called Nuggets

## Nugget
A Nugget is a piece of code that defines what that part can do, whether it is text, checkboxes, or an interactive image.

Nuggets can be provided either from built-in templates, or open-source repos from a boiler plate that ingot can read.
